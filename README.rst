VERSION: 0.3.1

Introduction
------------

Supply a wrapper ``StockDataFrame`` based on the ``pandas.DataFrame`` with
inline stock statistics/indicators support.

Supported statistics/indicators are:

- change (in percent)
- delta
- permutation (zero based)
- log return
- max in range
- min in range
- middle = (close + high + low) / 3
- compare: le, ge, lt, gt, eq, ne
- count: both backward(c) and forward(fc)
- SMA: simple moving average
- EMA: exponential moving average
- MSTD: moving standard deviation
- MVAR: moving variance
- RSV: raw stochastic value
- RSI: relative strength index
- KDJ: Stochastic oscillator
- Bolling: including upper band and lower band.
- MACD: moving average convergence divergence.  Including signal and histogram. (see note)
- CR:
- WR: Williams Overbought/Oversold index
- CCI: Commodity Channel Index
- TR: true range
- ATR: average true range
- line cross check, cross up or cross down.
- DMA: Different of Moving Average (10, 50)
- DMI: Directional Moving Index, including

  - +DI: Positive Directional Indicator
  - -DI: Negative Directional Indicator
  - ADX: Average Directional Movement Index
  - ADXR: Smoothed Moving Average of ADX

- TRIX: Triple Exponential Moving Average
- TEMA: Another Triple Exponential Moving Average
- VR: Volatility Volume Ratio

Installation
------------

``pip install stockstats``

Compatibility
-------------

Please check the `setup.py`_ file.

Note that pandas add some type check after version 1.0.
One type assert is skipped in ``StockDataFrame``.  Check ISSUE-50 for detail.

Tutorial
--------

- Initialize the ``StockDataFrame`` with the ``retype`` function which
  convert a ``pandas.DataFrame`` to a ``StockDataFrame``.

.. code-block:: python

    stock = StockDataFrame.retype(pd.read_csv('stock.csv'))


- Formalize your data.  This package takes for granted that your data is sorted
  by timestamp and contains certain columns.  Please align your column name.

  + ``open``: the open price of the interval

  + ``close``: the close price of the interval

  + ``high``: the highest price of the interval

  + ``low``: the lowest price of the interval

  + ``volume``: the volume of stocks traded during the interval

  + ``amount``: the amount of the stocks during the interval

- There are some shortcuts for frequent used statistics/indicators like
  ``kdjk``, ``boll_hb``, ``macd``, etc.

- The indicators/statistics are generated on the fly when they are accessed.
  If you are accessing through ``Series``, it may return not found error.
  The fix is to explicitly initialize it by accessing it like below:

.. code-block:: python

    _ = stock['macd']
    # or
    stock.get('macd')

- Using get item to access the indicators.  The item name following the
  pattern: ``{columnName_window_statistics}``.
  Some statistics/indicators has their short cut.  See examples below:

.. code-block:: python

    # volume delta against previous day
    stock['volume_delta']

    # open delta against next 2 day
    stock['open_2_d']

    # open price change (in percent) between today and the day before yesterday
    # 'r' stands for rate.
    stock['open_-2_r']

    # CR indicator, including 5, 10, 20 days moving average
    stock['cr']
    stock['cr-ma1']
    stock['cr-ma2']
    stock['cr-ma3']

    # volume max of three days ago, yesterday and two days later
    stock['volume_-3,2,-1_max']

    # volume min between 3 days ago and tomorrow
    stock['volume_-3~1_min']

    # KDJ, default to 9 days
    stock['kdjk']
    stock['kdjd']

    stock['cr-ma2_xu_cr-ma1_20_c']

MACDH Note:

In July 2017 the code for MACDH was changed to drop an extra 2x multiplier on the final value to align better with calculation methods used in tools like cryptowatch, tradingview, etc.
